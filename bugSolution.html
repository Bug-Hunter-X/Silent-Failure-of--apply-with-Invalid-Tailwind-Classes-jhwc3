The solution is to correct the misspelled class name.  In this case, replace `text-not-found` with a valid Tailwind class, such as `text-blue-600`:

```html
<div class="bg-red-500 @apply text-blue-600"></div>
```

Always verify that the utility classes you're using within `@apply` are correctly spelled and exist within your Tailwind configuration.  Consider using your IDE's autocompletion or a Tailwind CSS linter to catch potential errors during development.
